The **server.js**/**client.js** files at your application root are responsible for starting your application.

When you run the application with `npm start` the `Nullstack.start` method in both files will start your main component and return the [`context`](/context) object of their respectives environments.

The returned `context` could be used normally, and you can set it's `start` method which runs only once, being a good place for setting things up, as your database:

```jsx
import Nullstack from 'nullstack';
import Application from './src/Application';
import startDatabase from './database';

const context = Nullstack.start(Application);

context.start = async function() {
  context.database = await startDatabase(context.secrets);
}

export default context;
```

> ðŸ’¡ The `context.start` in **server.js** runs when the application is booted, and on **client.js** once the browser loads it

The `context` can be updated in any way as long as it be exported on both files, when building the app Nullstack turns it into a serverless function out-of-box.

## Dependency startup pattern

A nice pattern to work with dependencies that require startup time configurations is to define a `_start` function in the dependency:

```jsx
import Nullstack from 'nullstack';

class Dependency extends Nullstack {

  static async _start(context) {
    // start something with context
  }

}

export default Dependency;
```

And call it in the `context.start` passing the [context](/context):

```jsx
import Nullstack from 'nullstack';
import Application from './src/Application';
import Dependency from './src/Dependency';

const context = Nullstack.start(Application);

context.start = async function() {
  await Dependency._start(context);
}

export default Application;
```

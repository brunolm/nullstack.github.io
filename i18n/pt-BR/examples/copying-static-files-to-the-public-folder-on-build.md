To copy static files to the public folder you need to create a custom webpack override.

In order to modify the webpack config that comes in the Nullstack bundle, you can create a `webpack.config.js` as mentioned in the documentation ["How to customize Webpack"](/how-to-customize-webpack).

```js
// webpack.config.js
const [server, client] = require('nullstack/webpack.config')

const fse = require('fs-extra')

class CopyFiles {
  apply() {
    fse.copySync('node_modules/swagger-ui-dist', 'public/api-docs', {
      overwrite: true,
    })
  }
}

function customServer(...args) {
  const config = server(...args)
  config.plugins.push(new CopyFiles())
  return config
}

module.exports = [customServer, client]
```

In case you need to serve these files, you can use `context.server` to create a route and `express.static` to point to the files you want to serve.

```js
// server.js
context.server.use('/api-docs/', express.static(path.join(__dirname, '..', 'public/api-docs')))
// ...
```
